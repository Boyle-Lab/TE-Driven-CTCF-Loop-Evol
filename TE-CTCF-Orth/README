To create a basic version of Figure 2A, run the pipeline in create_ctcf_orthology_data.sh. The sizes/shapes of this figure will not match the published version, but the counts and labels will be correct. To produce the production figure, segments were individually manipulated in Adobe Illustrator to achieve a rough correspondence with the observed proportions.
